Criterion: Class design &amp; encapsulation
Score: 7/8
Evidence: Student uses a dedicated ATM class with private balance and clear public methods. Encapsulation is mostly correct, though some validation logic lives in main instead of the class.

Criterion: Control flow &amp; loops
Score: 5/6
Evidence: The main transaction loop repeats correctly and handles multiple menu choices. One edge case for invalid input exits early instead of reprompting.

Criterion: Style, clarity, and comments
Score: 3/4
Evidence: Variable names are readable and indentation is consistent. Comments describe the main methods but do not explain error handling or boundary cases.

Total Score: 15/18

Teacher Comment Summary:
Strong implementation of the ATM behavior with solid loop structure and mostly well‑designed classes. To improve, move more validation inside the ATM class and add comments explaining how you handle invalid input and edge cases.
